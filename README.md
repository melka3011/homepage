# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project for CS50W implements a general outline for a portfolio page. The page will be a foundation and will be built upon as new skills are acquired.

I choose Bootstraps Navbar to be the main navigation tool throughout web site and it also forms the general theme of the site.

Index.html - contains a basic header and a picture of myself. Providing access to the other sites through the navbar.

Assignmen.html - is the the filler assignment page where I included a table and used the grid layout system in order to finish off the project requirements.

Courses.html - is an unordered list of the course reccomendations which I found very helpful in starting up Computer Science

About.html - This page utilizes the card-deck Bootstrap component as a basic introduction tool to my main interest fields, giving insight to my personal preferences and current field of work

Project-disabled - I've added another link on the Navbar which is at this moment disabled. As I intent to participate and create other projects I would create another HTML and insert them as a general overview on my progress
